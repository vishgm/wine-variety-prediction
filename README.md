# Wine Variety Prediction using Machine Learning


## About this Repository:

This is a Machine Learning assignment. 

## Problem Statement:

To build a predictive model using the wine dataset to predict the **variety** of the wine. 


```
For example:- Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir...etc.
```

## Solution

### A complete analysis is available here : [Wine variety notebook](https://github.com/RepoMan20/wine-variety-prediction/tree/master/Data)

#### Contents: 

1. [Libraries used](#libraries)
2. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#eda)
3. [Visualizations](#viz)

## Libraries:

Libraries used :  ```
                  numpy,sklearn,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,ppscore
                  ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. Data cleaning
2. Features Selection
3. Feature encoding

## Selection of model 

Since majority of the dataset consists of categorical data, classification algorithms were used to strengthen the predictive power of the model.

Here two models were built viz: 

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

To determine the best model to use for this classification problem, a comparison was done between both the models.

The final result -  **Random Forest classifier** performed slightly better than the **Decision Tree Classifier** in terms of accuracy.
